# AlphaLoc

AlphaLoc is an ESP32 application that allows embedding GPS location data directly into Sony Alpha camera photos via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It acts as a bridge between a standard GPS module and your Sony camera, providing real-time geolocation tagging.

## Features

- **Automatic Geotagging**: Sends GPS coordinates (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Time) to the camera.
- **BLE Connection**: Emulates a smartphone location provider for Sony cameras.
- **Dual Configuration**: Configurable via a Web Interface (WiFi) or BLE characteristics.
- **Status Indicators**: NeoPixel (RGB LED) feedback for Camera connection, GPS fix, Battery, and WiFi status.
- **Low Power**: Supports disabling external peripherals (like Stemma QT) to save power.

## Hardware Support

The project is set up for **PlatformIO** and currently supports:

| Board | Environment | Pinout |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **DFRobot Beetle ESP32-C6** | `esp32c6` | GPS TX: 5, GPS RX: 4, NeoPixel: 6 |
| **Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3** | `esp32s3` | GPS TX: 38, GPS RX: 39, NeoPixel: 6 |

You can easily adapt it to other ESP32 boards by modifying `platformio.ini`.

## Usage

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Connect your GPS module (e.g., GY-GPS6MV2) to the defined TX/RX pins.

2. Flash the firmware using PlatformIO.

   ```bash
   pio run -e esp32c6 -t upload
   ```

3. Power on the device.

### 2. Pairing with Camera

1. On your Sony Alpha camera, go to **Network** -> **Bluetooth Settings**.
2. Enable **Bluetooth Function**.
3. Select **Pairing**.
4. The camera should discover "AlphaLoc". Select it to pair.
5. Once paired, go to **Location Info. Link Set.** and enable it.
6. The camera should now show the GPS icon (solid when receiving data).

### 3. LED Status Codes

The NeoPixel LED provides a visual "heartbeat" every 5 seconds. It flashes multiple colors in sequence to report the status of different subsystems:

**Sequence:** [Camera Status] -> [GPS Status] -> [Battery Status] -> [WiFi Status] -> [Sleep]

1.  **First Flash: Camera Connection**
    *   🟢 **Green**: Connected to camera and bonded.
    *   🔵 **Blue**: Connected to camera but not bonded yet.
    *   🔴 **Red**: Not connected.
2.  **Second Flash: GPS Fix**
    *   🟢 **Green**: Valid 3D GPS Fix acquired.
    *   🟣 **Violet**: Valid *fake* GPS fix (when `ALPHALOC_FAKE_GPS=1`).
    *   🔴 **Red**: No fix (searching for satellites).
3.  **Third Flash: Battery Level (Optional)**
    *   🟢 **Green**: > 50%
    *   🟡 **Yellow**: > 30%
    *   🔴 **Red**: <= 30%
4.  **Fourth Flash: WiFi/Config (Optional)**
    *   Only appears during the startup "Config Window" (first 5 minutes).
    *   🔵 **Blue**: Web server is active.
    *   ⚫ **(Off)**: Config window closed, WiFi disabled to save power.

**Example**:
*   🔴-🔴-🟢-🔵: No Camera, No GPS, Battery Good, Config Mode Active (Just turned on).
*   🔵-🟢-🟡-⚫: Camera Connected (Not Bonded Yet), GPS Fixed, Battery Medium, Normal Operation (Config closed).
*   🟢-🟢-🔴-⚫: Camera Connected (Bonded), GPS Fixed, Battery Low, Normal Operation (Config closed).
*   🔵-🟣-🟢-⚫: Camera Connected (Not Bonded Yet), Fake GPS Fixed, Battery Good, Normal Operation (Config closed).

### 4. Configuration

> **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: The BLE configuration service is **DISABLED by default** for security reasons. When enabled, it allows **UNAUTHENTICATED access** to device settings including WiFi passwords. Only enable it (`ALPHALOC_BLE_CONFIG=1`) in trusted environments or for initial setup, then rebuild with it disabled.

On startup, AlphaLoc enters a **Configuration Window** (default 5 minutes). During this time, you can change settings via WiFi (if `ALPHALOC_WIFI_WEB=1`) or BLE (if `ALPHALOC_BLE_CONFIG=1`).

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Camera Name Prefix** | Filter which cameras to connect to. Useful if you have multiple Sonys. | `SonyA7` |
| **Camera MAC Prefix** | Connect only to a specific MAC address prefix. Empty matches any. | (Empty) |
| **TZ Offset** | Timezone offset in minutes (e.g., `60` for UTC+1). | `60` |
| **DST Offset** | Daylight Savings Time offset in minutes. | `60` |
| **WiFi Mode** | `0` = Access Point (AP), `1` = Station (Client). | Station |
| **WiFi SSID/Pass** | Credentials for connecting to your home WiFi. | `WiFi` / `changeme` |
| **AP SSID/Pass** | Credentials for the hotspot created by AlphaLoc. | `AlphaLoc` / `alphaloc1234` |
| **Max GPS Age** | How long (seconds) to reuse old coordinates if GPS signal is lost. | `300` |

#### Method A: WiFi Web Interface

By default, the device attempts to connect to a WiFi network.

- **Default SSID**: `WiFi`
- **Default Password**: `changeme`
- **Mode**: TCP Station (Client)

If you compile with `APP_WIFI_MODE_AP` (or change it via BLE/Code), it acts as an Access Point:

- **AP SSID**: `AlphaLoc`
- **AP Password**: `alphaloc1234`
- **IP**: `192.168.4.1`

Navigate to the device IP in your browser to access the config page.

#### Method B: BLE Configuration

You can use a generic BLE app (like nRF Connect) to write to the configuration service.

## BLE Client Details (Camera Link)

AlphaLoc acts as a BLE client to Sony cameras

### Advertisement Filters

- **Manufacturer data**: company ID `0x012D`, product ID `0x0003`
- **Optional name prefix filter**: `camera_name_prefix` (if set)
- **Optional MAC prefix filter**: `camera_mac_prefix` (if set)

### Services and Identifiers

AlphaLoc looks for two Sony services (UUIDs are built from 16-bit IDs using the Sony base UUID):

```
Sony base UUID (constructed):
  00000000-0000-8000-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffff
  with 16-bit words inserted at positions:
    first = 0xDD00 / 0xFF00
    second = 0xDD00 / 0xFF00
```

It accepts either 128-bit UUIDs or 16-bit UUIDs:

- **Location Service**: `0xDD00`
- **Remote Service**: `0xFF00`

### Characteristic Discovery

Within those services, AlphaLoc searches for:

**Location Service (DD00)**

- `0xDD21`: Flags read to determine if TZ/DST are required
- `0xDD30`: Lock location (0x00 - Off, 0x01 - On)
- `0xDD31`: Enable location updates (0x00 - Off, 0x01 - On)
- `0xDD11`: Location write characteristic; used for sending GPS payloads

**Remote Service (FF00)**

- `0xFF02` (notification characteristic; CCCD `0x2902`)

### Connection/Discovery Flow (simplified)

```
ADV (Sony) --> connect
  |
  +--> discover DD00 (Location Service)
  |      +--> find DD11, DD21, DD30, DD31
  |      +--> read DD21 flag byte
  |      +--> enable location writes on DD11
  |
  +--> discover FF00 (Remote Service)
         +--> find FF02
         +--> find/guess CCCD (0x2902)
         +--> enable notifications
```

### Sending Location

Once services and characteristics are resolved:
- Builds a Sony-compatible location payload
- Writes to `DD11`
- Enables FF02 notifications after first location write (if required)

## Configuration Options

- **Camera Name Prefix**: Limits connection to cameras starting with this name (Default: "SonyA7").
- **Timezone/DST**: Offset in minutes for timestamp correction.
- **Max GPS Age**: How long to keep sending the last known location if GPS signal is lost.

## Building

This project uses the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF) within PlatformIO.
Check `platformio.ini` for build flags and pin definitions.

```ini
; Example Override
build_flags =
  -DGPS_UART_TX_PIN=5
  -DGPS_UART_RX_PIN=4
```

### Build Environments

The `platformio.ini` file defines several build environments for different purposes:

*   **`env:esp32c6`**: The standard production build for the ESP32-C6. Logging is disabled for performance.
*   **`env:esp32c6-debug`**: A debugging environment.
    *   Enables verbose logging (`ALPHALOC_VERBOSE=1`).
    *   **Enables Fake GPS (`ALPHALOC_FAKE_GPS=1`)**: Simulates a stationary location (Munich) for testing without a GPS module or satellite lock.
*   **`env:esp32c6-debug-gps`**: Debugging environment using *real* GPS data but with verbose logging enabled.
*   **`env:esp32s3-debug-gps`**: Debugging environment using *real* GPS data but with verbose logging enabled.

### Build Flags

You can customize the firmware behavior using these compilation flags in `platformio.ini`:

| Flag | Description | Default | Security Impact |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `ALPHALOC_WIFI_WEB` | Enable internal settings web server. Set to `0` to remove WiFi stack and save power/flash. | `1` | Medium - protect WiFi credentials |
| `ALPHALOC_BLE_CONFIG` | **Enable BLE configuration service.** | `0` (DISABLED) | **🔴 CRITICAL** - Exposes all settings via unencrypted BLE |
| `ALPHALOC_VERBOSE` | Enable extensive debug logging to serial UART. | `0` | Low - may log sensitive data |
| `ALPHALOC_FAKE_GPS` | Ignore UART GPS and output a static test location. | `0` | None |
| `ALPHALOC_NEOPIXEL_PIN`| GPIO pin number for the WS2812B NeoPixel. | (Board dependent) | None |
| `ALPHALOC_BATTERY_MONITOR` | Enable MAX17048 / LC709203F battery monitor over I2C. | `0` | None |
| `ALPHALOC_BATTERY_SDA_PIN` | I2C SDA pin for battery monitor. | (Board dependent) | None |
| `ALPHALOC_BATTERY_SCL_PIN` | I2C SCL pin for battery monitor. | (Board dependent) | None |
| `ALPHALOC_BATTERY_I2C_POWER_PIN` | Optional power-enable pin for I2C battery monitor. | (Unset) | None |
| `GPS_UART_TX_PIN` | TX Pin for GPS Serial (Connects to GPS RX). | (Board dependent) | None |
| `GPS_UART_RX_PIN` | RX Pin for GPS Serial (Connects to GPS TX). | (Board dependent) | None |
| `DALPHALOC_FACTORY_RESET` | If set to `1`, wipes NVS settings on boot. Dangerous. | Undefined | Medium - enables data wipe |

**Security Best Practices:**
- Keep `ALPHALOC_BLE_CONFIG=0` in production builds
- Only enable BLE config for initial setup in controlled environments
- Use WiFi config (`ALPHALOC_WIFI_WEB=1`) with strong AP password instead
- Change default WiFi credentials immediately after first boot
